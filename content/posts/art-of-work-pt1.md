Throughout my career I've always made a conscious effort to reflect on my current self. I reflect
on decisions I made in projects, mistakes I may have made (and if I could have done better),
directions I want to travel, etcetera. I also make a point to listen to others perspectives and
try to understand where those thoughts and perspectives come from. What motivates me? What motivates
them? What do we take for granted, and why?

Few topics come up more often than working on "fun and interesting technologies".

## Shiny Syndrome

I'm a software developer at my core. I _love_ working with tech. More importantly, I love _using_
tech to solve interesting problems. And this is where my first musing stems. I think I've seen
more developers make decisions based on the tech being shiny than the tech actually being applicable
to the problem at hand. It's not always (intentional) negligence or malice, but when confronted with
a question of "why?" the answers usually go something like:

* It's where the industry is going
* It's much more modern than existing tools
* This gets us street cred for hiring
* I guarantee it'll be better (usually when there is no base to compare to)

However, I think there are also some implicit motivators that make the above sound a little less innocent:

* It's new, not old and soggy
* I want to learn this tech (usually for resume buffing)
* I read an article that showed Company Foo did it with heralded success (end context)
