I've been musing on the Daily March with a coworker recently. Given the world around us, currently,
we've found ourselves discussing our value to our company, how we can ensure that sticks, and how
we can potentially improve that value while gaining personal value at the same time. Seems reasonable,
no?

We ended up going down a _very_ deep rabbit hole. The discussion was harrowing but humbling. It invigorated
us more than we anticipated. I'm going to try to break it down here!

## Who Do We Build For?

* Who are we writing code for?
* Why are we writing the code we are writing?
* What value does the code have?

We started with these questions, and oh how our answers differed!

We both agreed on `Who are we writing code for?`: we write code for other developers, not the machine (until we
identify a hot spot. Then we pull out the voodoo!). This is why we focus on organization, naming, patterns, and
clean code! You are focusing on those, right?? However - increasingly we are starting to see this idea being
bypassed, either intentionally or unintentionally, in favor of speed and cleverness.

With speed - deadlines seem to be the primary culprit cited. Agile environments especially. "Deadline is coming
up, just get it in" or "We can fix it later. Agile!". I find this sentiment a bit...disappointing? In trying to
break down why, I stumbled through a couple debated points:

* Why are the deadlines so far off?
* Are we going too slow?

## Shiny Syndrome

I'm a software developer at my core. I _love_ working with tech. More importantly, I love _using_
tech to solve interesting problems. And this is where my first musing stems. I think I've seen
more developers make decisions based on the tech being shiny than the tech actually being applicable
to the problem at hand. It's not always (intentional) negligence or malice, but when confronted with
a question of "why?" the answers usually go something like:

* It's where the industry is going
* It's much more modern than existing tools
* This gets us street cred for hiring
* I guarantee it'll be better (usually when there is no base to compare to)

However, I think there are also some implicit motivators that make the above sound a little less innocent:

* It's new, not old and soggy
* I want to learn this tech (usually for resume buffing)
* I read an article that showed Company Foo did it with heralded success (end context)
