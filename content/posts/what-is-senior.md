I've had a lot of trouble with this question lately: what is a Senior Developer? What value does a
Senior Developer bring that differentiates themselves from a Tech Lead? Should they be overlapping? It's
a discussion that's come up so much because I've been a Senior Developer for a number of years now. Every
step of the way I've been pushed to take on the role of a Lead. In some cases I have..and found the role
to consistently take me away from the code and development process I love. It's been a constant struggle,
and I'd like to try and recount my experience trying to push against this expectation.

I've chased this question with a number of people throughout my career: my Managers, my coworkers, company leaders,
even had the unique opportunity of discussing expectations with a company CEO (smaller company). Each time I asked
I got differing opinions about what a Senior Developer _should_ do. It made it far more difficult to reason about and
articulate the role that I actually want to pursue.

I do want to take this time to plug [Kitchen Soap's article](https://www.kitchensoap.com/2012/10/25/on-being-a-senior-engineer/)
which is a fantastic dive into the traits of a great Senior Developer. This article is more about the perceived
differences between a Senior Developer and a Lead, but Kitchen Soap was worth a mention!

## Leadership

"A Senior Developer should be a technical leader in the team". That's usually the first statement I hear when asking
what someone would use to describe a Senior Developer. Leadership, in general, often comes up
when I am discussing the role. Usually this is broken down into one or more of the following activities:

* Mentoring fellow team members to help them improve their own skills
* Guide technical decisions with expertise and problem solving
* Get buy in on said technical decisions with sound arguments (i.e not making emotion-based arguments, but logical ones)
* Be a go-to resource for questions / suggestions for solving problems

It's somewhat _implied_ by those bullets but these are mostly Leadership responsibilities. I've rarely heard someone
explicitly say "technical mastery". If I bring it up it usually garners a "oh, of course!" response, but it's interesting
that this seems to come across as an after-thought rather than the primary consideration.

Personally, I believe a Senior Developer should be focused on becoming a strong technical resource. They should be gaining
experience in as many facets of the Software Development Lifecycle as possible. As you can imagine, I don't believe in
the idea of a "Senior INSERT_TOOL_HERE Developer". I believe a true Senior Developer is a well rounded developer. They have
exposure to, at least, build processes, testing, deployments, infrastructure requirements, and clean code practices.

## Mentorship

One thing that I tend to agree with, though it has elements of leadership, is mentoring. Mentoring is, in my opinion,
something every Senior resource should be willing to do in some capacity. It's how I got the many opportunities,
experiences, and nuggets of wisdom throughout my career and I believe in giving back the same opportunities to
others.

I should clarify, though, that I don't personally believe in _blind_ mentor assignment. This is common in companies
that have formalized Mentoring Programs which, sometimes, are required participation for Senior Developers and up.
These types of random pairings have always felt inefficient to me for a couple reasons:

* Usually, unless I happen to know the participant, there is an element of rapport building that has to happen in the beginning
* Because rapport building takes time, this can reduce the efficacy of any knowledge sharing and possibly stifle challenging ideas
* The participant may not be enthused about the idea of mentoring in the first place, which creates quite the uncomfortable situation
* The pairing could end up being an unfulfilling time-sink

These issues are compounded if the Program is fix-timed, such as if the pairings are only set for, say, a month or two.

Instead, I like organic mentor pairings. This can happen naturally during a project, through conversation with coworkers, or even if
there is an initiated outreach in either direction driven by some motivating factor. Maybe the participant saw you solve a challenging
problem and wants to pick your brain on how. Maybe you have a reputation as the "go to person" for XYZ and they are interested in XYZ
themselves. In any case this is a much more natural pairing that doesn't feel forced and, importantly, there is less obligation to
continue the pairing if things seem to turn south.

## Senior Developer vs. Tech / Team Lead

My primary motivation for writing this post comes when you look at the differences between a Senior Developer and a Team / Tech
Lead (which I will refer to simply as "Lead" for brevity). Just about every company I have worked for or contracted for seems to
have varying ideas of what a Lead is, but there does seem to be some commonality:

* Leads keep the team on track for what should be worked on
* Leads field questions, clarify requirements, and act as mediator between the technical and business side
* Leads settle stuck quorum on technical decisions when the team is split on a decision / direction
* Leads look ahead to upcoming feature work, which has been properly groomed, to help drive decisions so the team doesn't get blindsided

The rest seems to vary depending on the company. Some companies merge a Lead and a Manager, expecting Leads to take on direct reports
in more of a HR responsibility. Some Leads are expected to settle inter-team conflicts as a neutral mediator. Some Leads are brought into
the Sales pipeline to help sell the project itself. There are many differing views but they all trend towards the same pitfall: **a Lead
builds fewer things**. This is quite the problem when your primary goal is Development Mastery.

When it comes to Senior Developers there almost seems to be an immediate expectation that your intent is to promote to a Lead.
This is especially true if:

* You are good at your job as a developer so management wants more people like you to be good as well
* If said management / leadership is not equipped to do this growth training themselves, now it's your problem
* There isn't enough seasoned technical leadership available at XYZ, Inc., so they need you to fill the gap

This expectation is what has caused so much friction for me, personally. I owe a lot to my mentors who taught me many of the
things I now know, but the idea of stepping away from code to do that, basically, full time makes me physically ill. People Management
especially: managing someone else's career is not what I want to do.

## Conclusion? Not Yet

For me, the question still remains: what can someone do to push back against these expectations while ensuring they don't create a bad
situation for themselves? This depends heavily on your company, your manager, and your career goals. I've found that keeping this topic
an ongoing discussion (and sticking point) as I progress keeps the discussion fresh and keeps accountability set for everyone involved.
An important thing to keep in mind is always make sure you're voicing your intentions clearly and consistently. Changing your story or
leaving things open for interpretation almost always results in issues. It's also not fair to your Manager / Supervisor who fields the
discussion as they may be unable to come to the table with sound advice if they are unsure what the problem and your thoughts on the
problem are. Open and clear communication is key!

I may update this post as I find possible solutions / helpful advice.

Thanks for stopping by the Lab!
