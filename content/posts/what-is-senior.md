Something of a theme in my career these last couple of years has been the constant flow towards leadership roles. A
change from an individual contributor (IC) to a Lead has a number of changes associated with it that aren't, always,
clearly communicated, and can have a drastic effect on an individual's overall happiness within this role. Now that
I've gone through the transition to Staff / Tech Lead (and Tech Lead to Architect) a handful of times now in my own
career and, now that I've jumped back to a Senior IC role 3 times, I felt like sharing my perspective.

Do note: this article is _riddled_ with personal opinion, personal experiences, and is aimed at sharing my experiences
in line with my own personal bias on what makes me happy as a developer (which is building and delivering products).
Take everything in this article with the appropriate amount of salt!

## Senior vs. Lead vs. Architect

To try and avoid this article being _too_ long I won't attempt to list out every nuance of the three roles I'm focusing
on. For me I've seen the following patterns for each role.

### Senior Individual Contributors

Senior ICs are mostly responsible for:

* Solving more complex or broader-scope problems (compared to junior / mid-level ICs)
* Assisting towards code quality through Code Reviews, pairings (where required), and some form of mentorship
  * I'll touch on this one later as this is a balancing act of commitment
* Autonomously completing their tasks while being mindful on when they're spinning their wheels
  * a.k.a - Seniors know when to stop and ask for help vs. suffering in silence and letting deadlines slip
* Depper subject matter expertise and breadth of knowledge
  * The difference in capability between a "Senior Specific-Language Developer" vs. a "Senior Developer" can be quite stark

(I do want to take this time to plug [Kitchen Soap's article](https://www.kitchensoap.com/2012/10/25/on-being-a-senior-engineer/)
which is a fantastic dive into the traits of a great Senior Developer!)

### Staff Engineer / Tech Lead

(Note: I've heard various explanations for why "Staff Engineer" makes more sense than Tech Lead. They're synonymous to me)

Staff Engineers / Tech Leads are in more of a technical leadership role. They are, usually, expected to be:

* Strong individual contributors
  * How else do you lead others if you haven't experienced Software Development's many facets?
* Empathetic Mentors
  * I added `empathetic` here because if you're a strong IC but have terrible people skills: you won't get far or you'll cause team attrition. Don't be that Lead
* Strategic Thinkers with an eye on, both, today's problems and tomorrow's goals (to try and plan roadmaps, accordingly)
* An ally to Product / Business
  * Technical-only focuses in leadership usually aren't very effective. Gotta lean on your peers!

## Why Progress?

For me: the progression from Senior IC to Staff (and, ultimately, Architect) wasn't really something I was chasing. It
happened naturally as a part of the "career progression" discussions I'd have with management and Senior Leadership about
where I should go next. The conversation always followed the same patterns:

1. Management wants to disucss my progression to higher roles as part of my performance review
2. I express interest in _learning_ more but want to better understand the change in responsibilities
  * This is, usually, responded to with something like "it's the same work you do now but a little more leadership ability!"
3. I engage in several discussions with management and others to try and learn what these differences are
  * Spoiler alert: it means being a developer much less and being a leader much more
4. If I get promoted: I find out how little time I get to spend being a developer
  * Similarly: I accept a new role elsewhere with a similar title, things are pretty nicely balanced for a while, but the same drop in IC work happens

### The Balancing Triangle

As a small aside: I am a firm believer in balancing three layers of expectations at work:

* What do I _want to do_?
* What is my role _required to do_?
* What does my team/company _need me to do_?

Finding a good balance of these three things is how I stay valuable to the company while also ensuring I stay happy in
what is, effectively, my passion in life. If I feel that happiness slipping then it's time to make changes.

## Senior IC

A core element of why I love software development so much is just how much _fun_ solving complex problems is; especially
when those solutions make someone else's job a little bit easier. My life's passion is mastering this craft. Naturally
this meant that, from a career perspective, solving more and more challenging problems, learning more tools, and learning
the various failure points possible would transition me into the role of a Senior IC.

A Senior IC was considered a technically-strong and autonomous developer capable of solving complex problems with little
oversight. They were leveraged in teams to tackle tougher technical challenges, or challenges with broader scope, than
a Junior to Mid-Level developer. Think the difference between working on a small part of a feature vs. designing and
building the whole feature (in some cases). A Senior is not just a doer and not only idenitified by their technical
strength. A Senior can draw from a well of experiences, especially failures, to help make more _grounded_ decisions that
may or may not involve the most complex of solutions. Weighing a simple solution vs. a complex solution TODO



## Leadership

"A Senior Developer should be a technical leader in the team". That's usually the first statement I hear when asking
what someone would use to describe a Senior Developer. Leadership, in general, often comes up
when I am discussing the role. Usually this is broken down into one or more of the following activities:

* Mentoring fellow team members to help them improve their own skills
* Guide technical decisions with expertise and problem solving
* Get buy in on said technical decisions with sound arguments (i.e not making emotion-based arguments, but logical ones)
* Be a go-to resource for questions / suggestions for solving problems

It's somewhat _implied_ by those bullets but these are mostly Leadership responsibilities. I've rarely heard someone
explicitly say "technical mastery". If I bring it up it usually garners a "oh, of course!" response, but it's interesting
that this seems to come across as an after-thought rather than the primary consideration.

Personally, I believe a Senior Developer should be focused on becoming a strong technical resource. They should be gaining
experience in as many facets of the Software Development Lifecycle as possible. As you can imagine, I don't believe in
the idea of a "Senior INSERT_TOOL_HERE Developer". I believe a true Senior Developer is a well rounded developer. They have
exposure to, at least, build processes, testing, deployments, infrastructure requirements, and clean code practices.

## Mentorship

One thing that I tend to agree with, though it has elements of leadership, is mentoring. Mentoring is, in my opinion,
something every Senior resource should be willing to do in some capacity. It's how I got the many opportunities,
experiences, and nuggets of wisdom throughout my career and I believe in giving back the same opportunities to
others.

I should clarify, though, that I don't personally believe in _blind_ mentor assignment. This is common in companies
that have formalized Mentoring Programs which, sometimes, are required participation for Senior Developers and up.
These types of random pairings have always felt inefficient to me for a couple reasons:

* Usually, unless I happen to know the participant, there is an element of rapport building that has to happen in the beginning
* Because rapport building takes time, this can reduce the efficacy of any knowledge sharing and possibly stifle challenging ideas
* The participant may not be enthused about the idea of mentoring in the first place, which creates quite the uncomfortable situation
* The pairing could end up being an unfulfilling time-sink

These issues are compounded if the Program is fix-timed, such as if the pairings are only set for, say, a month or two.

Instead, I like organic mentor pairings. This can happen naturally during a project, through conversation with coworkers, or even if
there is an initiated outreach in either direction driven by some motivating factor. Maybe the participant saw you solve a challenging
problem and wants to pick your brain on how. Maybe you have a reputation as the "go to person" for XYZ and they are interested in XYZ
themselves. In any case this is a much more natural pairing that doesn't feel forced and, importantly, there is less obligation to
continue the pairing if things seem to turn south.

## Senior Developer vs. Tech / Team Lead

My primary motivation for writing this post comes when you look at the differences between a Senior Developer and a Team / Tech
Lead (which I will refer to simply as "Lead" for brevity). Just about every company I have worked for or contracted for seems to
have varying ideas of what a Lead is, but there does seem to be some commonality:

* Leads keep the team on track for what should be worked on
* Leads field questions, clarify requirements, and act as mediator between the technical and business side
* Leads settle stuck quorum on technical decisions when the team is split on a decision / direction
* Leads look ahead to upcoming feature work, which has been properly groomed, to help drive decisions so the team doesn't get blindsided

The rest seems to vary depending on the company. Some companies merge a Lead and a Manager, expecting Leads to take on direct reports
in more of a HR responsibility. Some Leads are expected to settle inter-team conflicts as a neutral mediator. Some Leads are brought into
the Sales pipeline to help sell the project itself. There are many differing views but they all trend towards the same pitfall: **a Lead
builds fewer things**. This is quite the problem when your primary goal is Development Mastery.

When it comes to Senior Developers there almost seems to be an immediate expectation that your intent is to promote to a Lead.
This is especially true if:

* You are good at your job as a developer so management wants more people like you to be good as well
* If said management / leadership is not equipped to do this growth training themselves, now it's your problem
* There isn't enough seasoned technical leadership available at XYZ, Inc., so they need you to fill the gap

This expectation is what has caused so much friction for me, personally. I owe a lot to my mentors who taught me many of the
things I now know, but the idea of stepping away from code to do that, basically, full time makes me physically ill. People Management
especially: managing someone else's career is not what I want to do.

## Conclusion? Not Yet

For me, the question still remains: what can someone do to push back against these expectations while ensuring they don't create a bad
situation for themselves? This depends heavily on your company, your manager, and your career goals. I've found that keeping this topic
an ongoing discussion (and sticking point) as I progress keeps the discussion fresh and keeps accountability set for everyone involved.
An important thing to keep in mind is always make sure you're voicing your intentions clearly and consistently. Changing your story or
leaving things open for interpretation almost always results in issues. It's also not fair to your Manager / Supervisor who fields the
discussion as they may be unable to come to the table with sound advice if they are unsure what the problem and your thoughts on the
problem are. Open and clear communication is key!

I may update this post as I find possible solutions / helpful advice.

Thanks for stopping by the Lab!
